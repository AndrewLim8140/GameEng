# Weekly Reflection

## Week 1

Installed unity engine onto my laptop and followed through with the weekly practical lessons, completing the nessasary tasks. Apart from that , 
i also played around with the components of the GameObject trying to figure out on what each additional components does.  

Managed to successfully allow player's input to affect the camera's behavior, created a 3d capsule with mesh that serves as the player's body and allows 
for interactions, a flat plane for the players and objects to stand on, added **mesh** and **mesh collider** to allow for collision.  

As for github, as both Prefab and Scratch files are too large to be directly uploaded, i have searched the web and had chanced upon LFS (Large File Storage)
that could be used to upload large files like Library and Assets and referenced by git when nessasary. Had various issues occured however (i.e : forbidden 
files (.gitattribute referencing another .gitattribute), unclear and vague documentation for LFS) but at the end of the day , i manageed to successfully upload
to git hub.
